# XM Static Template

This template is made to quickly get started building a site without all the extras (PHP, libraries, etc).

### Instructions

To get started:

1. Download the [ZIP file of this repo](/xmmedia/xm_template_static/archive/master.zip).
2. Extra the ZIP file into a directory where you want to start working.
3. Run `npm install` at the command line to install the node libraries (for SASS compiling and JS minification).
4. Run `gulp watch` to start watching for changes (or just `gulp` to recompile everything).
5. Open `index.html` in `html` and start building.
